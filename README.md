Why this project exists
This project exists to perform a recon-level audit of Claude 4 that is ethical, obfuscated when necessary for testing, and technically precise in its findings. The audit takes a broad view. It asks how Claude 4 handles sensitive prompts, how it routes policy decisions, and how its interpretability tools reveal hidden behavior. It seeks to provide disciplined evidence that is useful to governance teams, security engineers, and researchers who want reliable insights without sensational claims.

Scope and guiding principles
This work covers a wide range of topics within the Claude 4 ecosystem. It looks at safety layers, alignment signals, and governance flows. It examines how the model handles ambiguous prompts, how it refuses or defers, and how it might be steered by policy routing. It also investigates how obfuscation in training or prompts affects understanding and traceability. The scope remains bounded by safety, legality, and practical usefulness. It avoids sensational claims and bases conclusions on repeatable tests and transparent methodology.

Audit framework
The audit follows a clear framework designed for rigor and reproducibility. It has four core pillars:
- Reconnaissance: scanning the model’s surface, prompts, and outputs to understand behavior.
- Obfuscation handling: testing how hidden prompts, prompt injection, or layered prompts influence results.
- Ethics and governance: ensuring tests respect privacy, dignity, and consent, and that conclusions support safer use.
- Technical precision: documenting all steps, data, and metrics so others can reproduce and verify results.

Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the first phase. It maps model behavior across domains, from general conversation to specialized tasks. It uses safe prompts that exercise capabilities without crossing safety lines. It tracks the model’s willingness to reveal reasoning, its refusal patterns, and its bias tendencies. It records how responses change when prompts are reframed, when context is limited, or when adversarial prompts are attempted in a controlled manner. The goal is to form a robust baseline of how Claude 4 behaves under normal conditions and under stress.

Obfuscation handling
Obfuscation testing examines how hidden or layered prompts might influence outcomes. It looks for signs that the system hides internal capabilities, or that it modulates behavior in unexpected ways under certain inputs. Tests consider prompt injection, context containment, and how policy routing interacts with edge cases. The findings emphasize both potential vulnerabilities and stabilizing factors that guard against misuse. The results guide improvements in prompt design, logging, and safety controls.

Ethics and governance
Ethics guide every test. The project follows a transparent, auditable process. It avoids exposing private data, secret configurations, or any sensitive prompts. It respects user consent and organizational boundaries. Governance is about creating evidence that helps teams govern usage responsibly. It also includes reviews by independent ethicists and legal counsel to ensure compliance with applicable rules and norms.

Technical precision
All tests come with precise definitions, expected outcomes, and clear criteria for success or failure. Data collection is documented, including input prompts, outputs, timestamps, and the exact tests run. Metrics are defined and replicable. Artifacts are stored in a structured way so others can reproduce the work. The aim is to produce results that are credible, verifiable, and directly actionable for developers and policy teams.

How Claude 4 is evaluated
Evaluation uses a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods. It emphasizes explainability, reproducibility, and safety. The evaluation plan is split into test suites, run logs, and interpretability checks. It includes:
- Capability tests: realistic tasks to gauge performance and safety trade-offs.
- Refusal and deferral tests: how the model handles unsafe requests.
- Policy routing tests: how routing affects outputs in edge cases.
- Interpretability checks: how much the model’s inner reasoning can be inferred from outputs.
- Stability tests: consistency across runs and prompts.

Evaluation is designed to be repeatable. Each test has a defined setup, a controlled environment, and a set of expected results. When results diverge, the system logs the reason and captures the evidence. This approach helps teams understand not just what happened, but why it happened.

Instrumentation and data collection
Tests rely on lightweight instrumentation that minimizes overhead and respects privacy. Logs capture the prompt, model response, timing, and a hash of sensitive content to prevent leakage. Anonymization is applied where appropriate to protect users. Results are stored in a structured format with versioning. This makes it easier to compare across releases and to track the impact of changes over time.

Ethical and legal considerations
Safety and legality are non-negotiable. The audit adheres to applicable data protection regulations and platform policies. It avoids collecting personal data unless explicitly needed for the test and with proper controls. When data is used, it is handled with care and stored securely. The project uses explicit consent for any live user testing. All artifacts are shared in a way that supports responsible research and safe deployment.

Governance, policy, and alignment
The project aligns with governance principles that promote responsible AI use. It includes clear policies for data handling, test design, and reporting. It also examines how Claude 4’s governance mechanisms influence outputs. The aim is to provide actionable guidance for teams that implement AI systems within strict governance frameworks. The alignment work weighs user safety, developer autonomy, and societal impact in balance.

Interpretability and transparency
Interpretability is central. Tests examine whether outputs can be traced to prompts and policy signals. The project includes tools to visualize decision paths and to audit how inputs map to outputs. It also explores how changes in the prompt or context alter responses. The goal is to help engineers understand the model’s behavior and to identify areas for improvement.

Red teaming and reflexive analysis
Red teaming methods push the model beyond typical usage. They probe for edge cases, safety gaps, and unintended consequences. Reflexive analysis means the team questions its own assumptions and tests. This self-review helps reduce bias in testing and fosters healthier skepticism. It also supports better reporting of findings and more reliable recommendations.

Tools, artifacts, and data handling
The repository hosts a suite of tests, scripts, and documentation artifacts. It emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and safety. Each artifact has a description, version, and usage notes. Artifacts include:
- Test harnesses for prompt testing
- Data schemas for test case definitions
- Small sample prompts designed to be safe yet revealing
- Logs and dashboards that summarize results
- Interpretability notebooks that illustrate decision paths

All data is organized to facilitate audit trails. Access is controlled, and sensitive content is protected. The tools are designed to be platform-agnostic so teams can adapt them to their own environments.
